### An open-source game development tycoon built in Godot

## Project Overview
This open-source project built in Godot is a game where you get to run your very own indie game studio. You get to manage your game studio, create games based on genres, topics, features, and wise employee management. The gameplay loop focuses on strategic decision-making, resource management, and responding to market trends.

This is a work in progress, and needs to go a long ways before it is as fun as it will be in my mind's eye. If you are interested, keep reading, and please reach out to me! I'd love to hear what you think.

## Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Start a Project:** Choose genre, sub-genre, topic, and initial features.
2. **Develop Game:** Manage employees, add features, and handle workload.
3. **Release:** Market the game, gather feedback, earn profits, and gain inspiration.
4. **Iterate & Improve:** Use feedback to improve your games, train staff, participate in game jams, research new features & technologies, and develop your game engine.
5. **Do it again!** Build a better game, hire new skill, gain new fans, and take your game development studio to the next level!

## Current Design Goals
- Implement a core gameplay loop:
	- Choosing type of game,
	- Choosing features,
	- Assigning employees,
	- Finishing game,
	- Receiving game score and sales.
- Flesh out genres, mechanics, and topics.
- Flesh out features which have genre/mechanic/topic combos.
- Flesh out employee & team mechanics, including experience gain, team lead mechanic, and inspiration.
- Add basic market dynamics and competitors.
- Add continuity through playthroughs
- Add additional game add-ons such as DLCs, sequels, merch, in-game purchases, and intellectual property.
- Add mod support.

## How to Contribute
### Explore the source code
Always feel free to explore the source code, fix bugs, or help contribute!
Playing the game is as simple as clone the repository and opening the project in Godot Engine 4.4 Mono. Ensure that git submodules are initialized as well. At this point you can easily edit GDscripts, however editing & building the C# scripts may take some more work.

### Playtest the game
This game is not yet in a playable state, so cannot yet be playtested.

### Get in contact
